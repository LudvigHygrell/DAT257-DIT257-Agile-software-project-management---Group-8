The Big Give was the BIGGEST day of online giving in South Central Texas, raising in excess of $50 million dollars for the local nonprofit 
community over the past twelve years. During a single 24-hour period, residents from across our 15-county region and beyond came together to 
support more than 400 nonprofits by making a donation to support the critical services they provide our community. Thank you for your generosity!

Big Give 2025 was held from Wednesday September 17th at 6 PM thru Thursday September 18th at 6 PM. Stay tuned for the Big Give 2026 date!
