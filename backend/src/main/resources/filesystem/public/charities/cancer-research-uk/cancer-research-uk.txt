Cancer Research UK was formed more than 20 years ago, in 2002. However, our history goes back much further, to 1902, 
with the founding of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund. Thanks to supporters like you, our pioneering work into how to prevent, 
diagnose and treat cancer has benefitted millions of lives over the past 120 years. Find out more about how our research has already 
made a difference to patients and what we are funding right now.
