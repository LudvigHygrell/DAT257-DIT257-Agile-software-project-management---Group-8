# Pages Folder

**Purpose:** Full-page views of the app, usually tied to routes.

**Contents:**
- `Homepage.jsx` → Homepage.
- `Charitypage.jsx` → Charitypage.
- `Userpage.jsx` → Userpage.

**Notes:**
- Pages arrange components but rarely contain low-level UI logic.
- Each page corresponds to a URL route.
